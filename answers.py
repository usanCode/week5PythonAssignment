#Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). 
#However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() 
# prints "Driving" üöó, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ‚úàÔ∏è)

    def speak(self):
        print("Animal is speaking")

        print("Hello!")
